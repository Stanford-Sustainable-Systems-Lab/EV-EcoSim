# TODO: How to model power delivery as a function of time, temperature, SOC and SOH at every time step. Cap as a...
#  function of discharge rate Fixed capacity
#  How to locate batteries spatially
#  Control Signals given to battery may vary slightly from response. How is the discharge current of battery controlled?
#  Is there a relationship between controls cost (temp control etc) with increasing power delivery by battery?
#  How can we incorporate this response delay due to chemistry or reaction responsiveness into simulation?
#  Finishing these will be great first battery sim environment. Maybe ignore details for now.
#  Think about creating a few degradation models from literature.
#  Need to obtain battery discharge curves for real simulation; can we get sample discharge curves or is it necessary?
#  I want to understand the communication protocol between EV and Station when plugged in and how that will affect batt.
#  How is the power from the battery mixed with that from the grid? I assume voltage must match.
#  Need voltage vs SOC curves to use to infer voltage from SOC so degradation can be computed (depends on C-rate too!).
#  Determining a batteryâ€™s state of charge from voltage measurement is  vague enough if current is moving
#  through the battery. The vagaries increase exponentially if no current is moving through the battery.
#  Available capacity is dependent on rate of discharge. This will ideally be dynamic in sim but static in control algo.
#  Need to consider Peukert's law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peukert%27s_law
#  Topologies for batteries in series vs. parallel and how does affect design as well. Voltage/current boosting.
#  SOC vs. Voltage vs. Discharge Rate
#  How does solution improve with horizon length (how far is looking ahead important (for MPC no point but computation
#  can become expensive. Horizon length 'N' vs. optimal savings analysis.
#  I see how RL can be used here to learn a policy with time. Opt. Algo with improve itself based on feedback from aging
#  sim module. SHOULD I INCLUDE UNCERTAINTY IN VOLTAGE??
