Welcome to EV-Ecosim 1.0.0
=====================================
EV-Ecosim is a grid-aware python-based co-simulation platform for modeling and simulation of EV charging
stations integrated with Solar and Battery systems. This tool is mostly built in python, and interfaces with GridLAB-D,
a 3-phase unbalanced power flow solver, to estimate the impacts of Fast Charging Stations on power distribution
networks.

We have made a web-tool version available for public use. It runs most of the code shown in this API documentation.

The project is accessible via Github and still under active development and improvements.

# A mini-tutorial for running a simple case is shown below.
# Include information on the container
